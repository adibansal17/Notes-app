# Notes-app

I've created this application using node.js and npm modules.
This notes application basically takes inputs as command lines arguments and display the result in the notes.json file.
This application can perform various like :
Adding a note.
Removing a note.
Listing the notes.
Reading the notes.

The npm modules used in programming of this application are :
vargs [makes the command line interface friendly.]
chalk [ used for styling the command line results]
